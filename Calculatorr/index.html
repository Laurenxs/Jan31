     <h3>HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARIMARRRRRR<333</h3>
      <br>
      I'm happy to be one of the people who gets to greet you or/and witness this special moment.
      <br><br><br>

      <br>
      The first moment I saw you is still clear in my mind.
      <br>
      And in these Three years of seeing each other—being together with the Bangags or our 
      <br>
      Qupal friends—I've seen how much you have grown.
      <br>
      You adapted to the situations we were in, you changed, NagGayon charr, you became more mature.
      <br><br>
      Even with all these changes, there's one thing I can say that will never change:
      <br><br>
      You became a part of me (of us) that I can never be ignored, or forgot(ten).
      <br><br><br>
      Though we may not talk to each other that much or often(I'm busy talking to myself
      <br>
      or overthinking abt some nonsense things),
      <br>
      I would never hesitate to reply or to be there whenever you have something to ask or say...
      <br><br><br>
      <h4>I pray for your Good health and Strength always—</h4>
      <br>
      the strength to do everything, to endure those/some hard moments,
      <br>
      and to experience good things and achieve your plans, 
      <br>
      whether they are yours or part of the Lord's plan for you.
      <br>

     <h4> Luvvyaa always, muahh 💋</h4>
     <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
